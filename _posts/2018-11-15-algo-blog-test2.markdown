<p class="lead">It’s no surprise that during the holiday season, Black Friday & Cyber Monday are absolutely critical events for any e-commerce business. According to Adobe, online retailers earned $108.15B between Nov 1 and Dec 31 2017, up 13.8% from 2016. Only in the U.S.</p>

Since the holiday season presents an enormous opportunity, it can also be a hit or miss. Given how short the season is and how a mere two days of activity can so heavily reflect in sales numbers, something going wrong may mean huge losses in revenue. It happens to the biggest brands—In 2017, large retails experienced online outages on Black Friday, such as Lowe’s or H&M.
